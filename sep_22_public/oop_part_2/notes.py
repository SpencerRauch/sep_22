OOP -- THE FOUR PILLARS

Encapsulation --
    Grouping code together into these entities we call classes



Inheritance
    Ability to create subclasses that have all the attributes and methods of the parent class
    key word super() will access the parent class

Polymorphism
    Child classes can have different definitions for the same methods, different values for the same attributes by 
    overwriting the values from the parent

Abstraction
    Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation, and we can hide attributes or methods that a Barista doesn't need to know about, like a CoffeeM. That way the Barista can make a cup of coffee in a simpler manner

Packages + Modules
Modules are just .py files that hold functionality -- they might be made up of functions, classes, variables, etc
Packages -- are directories that hold multiple modules
